'''
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

            if num not in numCounts:

            # Else add 1 to count
            else:
                numCounts[num] += 1

        return max(numCounts, key=numCounts.get)
